    "What is AI?": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.",
    "What is Machine Learning?": "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.",
    "What is Deep Learning?": "Deep Learning is a specialized branch of Machine Learning that uses layered neural networks to learn from large amounts of data.",
    "What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?": "NLP is a field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, making interactions between computers and humans more natural.",
    "What are common applications of AI?": "AI is used in various applications such as voice assistants, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, image and speech recognition, and healthcare diagnostics.",
    "How does AI work?": "AI works by processing large amounts of data through algorithms that detect patterns and learn from them. This allows AI systems to make predictions or decisions based on the input data.",
    "Is AI the same as Machine Learning?": "Not exactly. AI is the broader concept of making machines think and act intelligently, while Machine Learning is a subset of AI focused on building systems that learn from data.",
    "Can AI be biased?": "Yes, AI can be biased if it is trained on data that reflects existing biases. Ensuring diverse and balanced datasets is key to reducing such biases.",
    "What is reinforcement learning?": "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties in return.",
    "What are the ethical concerns of AI?": "Ethical concerns include bias in decision-making, privacy issues, potential job displacement, lack of transparency, and ensuring accountability for AI decisions.",
    "What is computer vision?": "Computer vision is a field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos.",
    "What is the future of AI?": "The future of AI promises improvements in healthcare, transportation, and automation, but it also brings challenges such as ethical considerations, job market changes, and the need for rigorous oversight."
